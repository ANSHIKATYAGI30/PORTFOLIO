    <h3>
        Hey ! 
       I'm Anshika. I'm 13 years old.
       I'm currently living in Ghaziabad.
       I'm currently studying in 9th Standard in St. Thomas School.
       I'm the Deputy Head girl of my school.
       Holding such a position obviously pushes me to achieve more and stay focused.
       Therefore, I try to set a good example for others to follow.
       I'm an Adventurous person too.
       I like to do a creative thing besides doing old stuff again and again.
       Learning new things is one thing which I always enjoy.
       I have keen interest in Biology , Chemistry , Maths and Information technology. I'm good at other subjects too but these attract 
       me the most.
